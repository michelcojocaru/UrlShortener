Description of design and implementation:

I used Node.js, Express and MongoDB (with mongoose interactions).

The design pattern is MVC.

The front-end was written in pure HTML & CSS.

Followed an online tutorial for url shortener.
As I made it as a stand-alone website, I have put most of the logic in the post endpoint. [CHECK README FOR LOGIC]
There I first locate the CRUD method used (which button has been pressed) and interact directly with the DB (which is
structured as a hashmap (_id:url))
-> _id = shortened url (encoded part which should be after /)
  longUrl = original url
  (additionally I also added a timestamp - created_at)
